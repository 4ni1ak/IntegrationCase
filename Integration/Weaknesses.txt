Double-Check Locking:
In the SaveItem method, double-check locking is being used, which is generally considered error-prone and should be avoided.
Instead, an atomic insertion operation should be used.
This helps prevent potential issues that can arise when dealing with multithreading.

Not Fully Thread-Safe:
While some parts of the code are protected against concurrent access, other sections may still lack proper protection. 
Specifically, the FindItemsWithContent and GetAllItems methods directly access the _itemIntegrationBackend object, which can lead to concurrency issues.
Ensuring full thread safety throughout the code is essential.
